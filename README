INSTALLATION:

To install simply add 'selenium-rake' to your Gemfile:
`gem 'selenium-rake'`

PREREQUISITES
* The Selenium framework requires a Java runtime to be installed. Run `java -v` in a terminal to see if you have it.



RAKE TASKS

* `rake rc`: starts the Selenium RC server
* `rake rc:stop`: stops the Selenium RC server
* `rake rc:tests`: Run all tests in the test/functional folder with _selenium in the filename


RUBY ON RAILS GENERATORS

* `rails generate config`: Add a global_config method to your tests to manage Selenium config settings.
* `rails generate example`: Generate an example Selenium test to help get you started.


LICENSING AND CONTRIBUTION

Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn’t been implemented or the bug hasn’t been fixed yet

Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn’t requested it and/or contributed it

Fork the project

Start a feature/bugfix branch

Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution

Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don’t break it in a future version unintentionally.

Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
